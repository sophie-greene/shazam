<lyricssnippet>
I feel you now from here
Our time is not done yet
You’ve given me my fullest heart
We’ll never be apart
I’m breathing through you now
</lyricssnippet>

<lyricsnippetsynced>
I’ve never been so exposed
Are there pieces still yet to be
Discovered with your love?
I can see anything through wherever you are
I can feel you
